• Extended timeout to 10 minutes (from previous shorter timeouts)

I am currently exploring all options to keep the service running.
        
        The app will continue to work until March 9, 2026. I cannot guarantee that the app will work after that date. In the situation that the app DOES shut down, I want to thank everyone who has used and supported SpotTransfer. It has been an absolutly amazing journey building and maintaining this project, and I am grateful for all the postive responses and feedback from you guys.
